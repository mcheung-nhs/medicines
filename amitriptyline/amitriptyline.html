            <ul>
<li>Amitriptyline is widely used as an antidepressant, but at lower doses it's also very good for treating pain and preventing migraine.</li>
<li>It usually takes 2 to 6 weeks for amitriptyline to fully work against pain or migraine, and 4 to 6 weeks for amitriptyline to fully work against depression.</li>
<li>Side effects such as a dry mouth and constipation are common. They're usually mild and go away after a couple of weeks - especially if you're taking lower doses of amitriptyline for pain or migraine.</li>
<li>Amitriptyline can make you feel sleepy so it's best to take it in the evening or before you go to bed.</li>
<li>Amitriptyline can cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it suddenly. Talk to your doctor if you're thinking of stopping taking amitriptyline.   </li>

    <p>Amitriptyline can be taken by adults for depression, pain and migraine.</p>
<p>It can be taken by children aged 16 to 17 years for depression.</p>
<p>It can also be taken by children aged 2 to 17 years for some types of nerve pain and for migraine.</p>
<p><strong>Amitriptyline </strong><strong>isn't suitable for some people. Check with your doctor before starting to take amitriptyline if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>have had an allergic reaction to amitriptyline or any other medicine in the past</li>
<li>have a heart problem - amitriptyline can make some heart problems worse</li>
<li>have a rare illness called porphyria</li>
<li>have liver or kidney problems</li>
<li>have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Epilepsy/Pages/Introduction.aspx">epilepsy</a> - amitriptyline can increase seizures</li>
<li>have ever taken any other medicines for depression. Some rarely-used antidepressants can interfere with amitriptyline to cause very <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(high)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">high blood pressure</a> even after you have stopped taking them.</li>
<li>are trying to become pregnant, are already pregnant or you are breastfeeding - amitriptyline is not always recommended in pregnancy or while breastfeeding</li>
<li>have an eye problem called <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Glaucoma/Pages/Introduction.aspx">glaucoma</a> - amitriptyline can increase the pressure in your eye </li>
<li>have thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diabetes/Pages/Diabetes.aspx">diabetes</a>, amitriptyline may change your blood sugar level. Check your blood sugar more often for the first few weeks of treatment with amitriptyline. Talk to your diabetes doctor if the reading goes too high or low.</p>

  <section class="o-list-sections__section o-section">
      <h2 class="o-section__header" id="how-when">How and when to take it</h2>
    <p>It's usual to take amitriptyline once a day before bedtime.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you're just starting treatment, you may be told to take a lower dose 2 or 3 times a day until you get used to the medicine. This is because taking a smaller dose 2 or 3 times a day for a while can reduce the chance of you having side effects.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline doesn't usually upset your tummy. You can take it with or without food.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablet with a drink of water - if you chew it, it tastes bitter.</p>
<h3>How much will I take?</h3>
<p>Amitriptyline tablets come in different strengths of 10mg, 25mg or 50mg.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline liquid comes in 3 different strengths where 5ml is equal to 10mg, 25mg or 50mg.</p>
<h4>Amitriptyline for pain and migraine</h4>
<p>The usual starting dose in adults and children aged 12 to 17 years is 10mg a day. If this doesn't work, the dose may increase.</p>
<p>The starting dose for younger children depends on their weight and symptoms.</p>
<p>The maximum dose of amitriptyline for treating pain is 75mg per day. It can be higher if you're taking it to prevent migraine.</p>
<h4>Amitriptyline for depression</h4>
<p>The usual dose in adults is 50mg to 75mg a day. If this doesn't work, the dose may go up to 150mg to 200mg.</p>
<p>Children aged 16 to 17 years and older people sometimes start on a lower dose of 25mg to 50 mg a day to reduce the chance of side effects. </p>
<p>The maximum dose of amitriptyline for depression is 200mg per day.</p>
<h3><strong>What if I forget to take it?</strong></h3>
<p>If you take amitriptyline once a day and forget a dose, don't worry. Take your next dose the next day at the usual time.</p>
<p>If you take amitriptyline 2 or 3 times a day and forget a dose, take it as soon as you think about it unless it's close to the time for your next dose.</p>
<p>If taking the missed dose might make you drowsy and you need to drive or use tools or machinery, leave out the missed dose and carry on with the next dose as normal.</p>
<p>Never take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
<p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p>
<h3><strong>What if I take too much?</strong></h3>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice straight away. An overdose can lead to potentially serious symptoms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>shaking</li>
<li>drowsiness</li>
<li>change in your heartbeat</li>
<li>seizures</li>
</ul>

    <p>Like all medicines, amitriptyline can cause side effects in some people, but many people have no side effects or only minor ones. Some of the common side effects of amitriptyline will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.</p>
<p>If you're taking amitriptyline for pain or migraine, the side effects of amitriptyline are usually less severe and last for less time than if you're taking amitriptyline for depression.</p>
<h3><strong>Common side effects</strong></h3>
<p>Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these common side effects bother you or don't go away:</p>
<ul>
<li>constipation</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>dry mouth</li>
<li>feeling sleepy, tired or weak</li>
<li>difficulty peeing</li>
<li>headache</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Serious side effects</strong></h3>
<p>It happens rarely, but some people have a serious side effect after taking amitriptyline. Tell a doctor straight away if you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>a fast or irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>yellow skin or eyes - these can be signs of a liver problem</li>
<li>headache, feeling confused, weakness, muscle cramps and seizures - these can be signs of a low sodium level in your blood</li>
<li>thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life</li>
<li>weakness on one side of your body, trouble speaking or thinking, loss of balance or blurred eyesight - these can be signs of a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Stroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx">stroke</a></li>
<li>eye pain, a change in your eyesight, swelling or redness in or around the eye</li>
<li>severe constipation or you're unable to pee and it's causing severe tummy pain</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Serious allergic reaction</strong></h4>
<p>In rare cases, it’s possible to have a serious allergic reaction to amitriptyline.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><span class="c-callout__emergency"><strong>A serious allergic reaction is an emergency. Contact a doctor straight away if you think you or someone around you is having a serious allergic reaction. </strong></span></p>
<p>The warning signs of a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">serious allergic reaction</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin</li>
<li>wheezing</li>
<li>tightness in the chest or throat</li>
<li>having trouble breathing or talking</li>
<li>swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>constipation </strong>- eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals. Try to drink several glasses of water or another non-alcoholic liquid every day. If you can, it may also help to do some exercise. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgpAQ-cirU">Watch a short video</a> on how to treat constipation.</li>
<li><strong>dizziness - </strong>this is probably due to <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(low)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">low blood pressure</a>. Drink plenty of water or a non-alcoholic drink. Do not stand up too quickly after sitting or lying down.</li>
<li><strong>dry mouth</strong> - chew sugar-free gum or sugar-free sweets</li>
<li><strong>feeling sleepy</strong> <strong>or tired </strong>- take amitriptyline in the evening and cut down the amount of alcohol you drink</li>
<li><strong>difficulty peeing - </strong>relax when you try to pee - don't try to force the flow of urine. If it doesn't happen, try again later. Talk to your doctor urgently if you can't pee at all.</li>
<li><strong>headache</strong> - make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Don't drink too much alcohol. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.</li>

    <p>Amitriptyline is not generally recommended in pregnancy or while breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Your doctor will only prescribe amitriptyline for you while you're pregnant or breastfeeding if the benefits of taking the medicine outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline has been linked with a small risk of problems for the unborn baby if you take it in early or late pregnancy.</p>
<h4>For depression</h4>
<p>Talk to your doctor. There may be other antidepressants that you can take instead of amitriptyline.</p>
<h4>For pain and migraine</h4>
<p>Talk to your doctor about other ways to treat your pain or migraine. <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/">Paracetamol</a> is usually the first choice of painkiller if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.

    <p>Amitriptyline is from a group of medicines called tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
<h4>For depression</h4>
<p>It's thought to work by increasing a chemical called serotonin in the brain. This can improve your mood.</p>
<h4>For pain and migraine</h4>
<p>Amitriptyline can also change the way that your nerves receive pain signals. This can help with certain types of nerve pain including <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Back-pain/Pages/Introduction.aspx">back pain</a> and neuralgia. It can also help to prevent <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/migraine/Pages/Introduction.aspx">migraine attacks</a>.</p>

    <p>You may see an improvement in your symptoms after a couple of weeks, although it usually takes between 4 and 6 weeks before you feel the full benefits.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking amitriptyline after a week or two just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least 6 weeks to work.</p>

    <h4><span>For depression</span></h4>
<p><span>Amitriptyline helps to jump start your mood so you feel better. You may notice that you sleep better and get on with people more easily because you're less anxious. Hopefully, you'll <span>take little things that used to worry you in your stride.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Amitriptyline won't change your personality or make you feel euphorically happy. It will simply help you feel like yourself again.</span></p>
<p>Don't expect to feel better overnight, though. Some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they begin to feel better.</p>
<h4>For pain and migraine</h4>
<p>You'll be taking a lower dose than that taken for depression. Taking amitriptyline as a painkiller won't change your personality or make you feel any different - although many people say they sleep better while they're taking amitriptyline.</p>

    <h4>For depression</h4>
<p>Once you're feeling better it's likely that you will continue to take amitriptyline for several more months. Most doctors recommend that you take antidepressants for 6 months to a year after you've stopped feeling depressed. Stopping before then can make depression come back</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of continuing to take amitriptyline for longer than a few months. It will depend on how bad your symptoms are, whether it's a one-off problem or one that keeps coming back, how well amitriptyline works for you and whether you've had any bad side effects.</p>
<h4>For pain and migraine</h4>
<p>Once you're feeling better you'll probably continue to take amitriptyline for as long as it's working for you. Some people take it for many months and even for years.</p>

    <p>Amitriptyline can change how hungry you feel. Some people feel more hungry when they're taking it - others feel less hungry. So your weight may change when you first start taking it.</p>

    <p>Amitriptyline doesn’t work any better or worse than other antidepressants. However, for some people, the side effects are a problem and they may have less side effects with another antidepressant. Sometimes people respond better to one antidepressant than to another.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you aren't feeling any better after taking amitriptyline for 6 weeks or if the side effects are still a problem</p>

<li>women having some vaginal bleeding</li>
<li>both men and women having breast swelling</li>

<ul>
<li>methadone</li>
<li>stimulants like MDMA (ecstasy) or cocaine</li>
<li>hallucinogens like LSD</li>
