<li>Amitriptyline can make you feel sleepy so it's best to take it in the evening or before you go to bed.</li>
<li>Amitriptyline can cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it suddenly. Talk to your doctor if you're thinking about stopping taking amitriptyline.   </li>

      <h2 class="o-section__header" id="who-can-take">Who can and can&#39;t take amitriptyline</h2>
    <p>Amitriptyline can be taken by adults and children aged 16 to 17 years for depression or low mood.</p>
<p><strong>Amitriptyline </strong><strong>isn't suitable for some people. Check with your doctor before starting to take amitriptyline if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>have had an allergic reaction to amitriptyline or any other medicine in the past</li>
<li>have a heart problem - amitriptyline can make some heart problems worse</li>
<li>have a rare illness called porphyria</li>
<li>have liver or kidney problems</li>
<li>have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Epilepsy/Pages/Introduction.aspx">epilepsy</a> - amitriptyline can increase seizures</li>
<li>have ever taken any other medicines for depression. Some rarely-used antidepressants can interfere with amitriptyline to cause very <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(high)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">high blood pressure</a> even after you have stopped taking them.</li>
<li>are trying to become pregnant, are already pregnant or you are breastfeeding – amitriptyline is not always recommended in pregnancy or while breastfeeding</li>
<li>have an eye problem called <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Glaucoma/Pages/Introduction.aspx">glaucoma</a> - amitriptyline can increase the pressure in your eye </li>
<li>have thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diabetes/Pages/Diabetes.aspx">diabetes</a>, amitriptyline may change your blood sugar level. Check your blood sugar more often for the first few weeks of treatment with amitriptyline. Talk to your diabetes doctor if the reading goes too high or low.</p>

  <section class="o-list-sections__section o-section">
      <h2 class="o-section__header" id="how-when">How and when to take it</h2>
    <p>It's usual to take amitriptyline once a day before bedtime.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you're just starting treatment, you may be told to take a lower dose 2 or 3 times a day until you get used to the medicine. This is because taking a smaller dose 2 or 3 times a day for a while can reduce the chance of you having side effects.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline doesn't usually upset the tummy so you can take it with or without food.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablet with a drink of water - if you chew it, it tastes bitter.</p>
<h3><strong>How much will I take?</strong></h3>
<p>Amitriptyline tablets come in different strengths of 10mg, 25mg or 50mg.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline liquid comes in 3 different strengths where 5ml is equal to 10mg, 25mg or 50mg.</p>
<p>The usual dose of amitriptyline for depression in adults is 50 to 75mg a day. This may go up to 150mg to 200mg a day if you need a stronger dose.</p>
<p>Children aged 16 to 17 years and older people sometimes start on a lower dose of 25mg to 50 mg a day to reduce the chance of side effects. </p>
<p>The maximum dose of amitriptyline is 200mg per day.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>What if I forget to take it</strong>?</strong></h3>
<p>If you take amitriptyline once a day and forget a dose, don't worry. Take your next dose the next day at the usual time.</p>
<p>If you take amitriptyline 2 or 3 times a day and forget a dose, take it as soon as you think about it unless it's close to the time for your next dose.</p>
<p>If taking the missed dose might make you drowsy and you need to drive or use tools or machinery, leave out the missed dose and carry on with the next dose as normal.</p>
<p>Never take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
<p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p>
<h3><strong>What if I take too much?</strong></h3>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice straight away. An overdose can lead to potentially serious symptoms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>vomiting</li>
<li>shaking</li>
<li>drowsiness</li>
<li>change in your heartbeat</li>
<li>seizures</li>

    <p>Like all medicines, amitriptyline can cause side effects in some people, but many people have no side effects or only minor ones. Some of the common side effects of amitriptyline will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.</p>
<h3><strong>Common side effects</strong></h3>
<p>Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these common side effects bother you or don't go away:</p>
<ul>
<li>constipation</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>dry mouth</li>
<li>feeling sleepy, tired or weak.</li>
<li>difficulty peeing</li>
<li>headache</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Serious side effects</strong></h3>
<p>It happens rarely, but some people have a serious side effect after taking amitriptyline. Tell a doctor straight away if you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>a fast or irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>yellow skin or eyes - these can be signs of a liver problem</li>
<li>headache, feeling confused, weakness, muscle cramps and seizures - these can be signs of a low sodium level in your blood</li>
<li>thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life</li>
<li>weakness on one side of your body, trouble speaking or thinking, loss of balance or blurred eyesight - these can be signs of a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Stroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx">stroke</a></li>
<li>eye pain, a change in your eyesight, swelling or redness in or around the eye</li>
<li>severe constipation or you're unable to pee and it's causing severe tummy pain</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Serious allergic reaction</strong></h4>
<p>In rare cases, it’s possible to have a serious allergic reaction to amitriptyline.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><span class="c-callout__emergency"><strong>A serious allergic reaction is an emergency. Contact a doctor straight away if you think you or someone around you is having a serious allergic reaction. </strong></span></p>
<p>The warning signs of a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">serious allergic reaction</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin</li>
<li>wheezing</li>
<li>tightness in the chest or throat</li>
<li>having trouble breathing or talking</li>
<li>swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not all the side effects of amitriptyline. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.</p>

    <h3><strong>What to do about:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>constipation - </strong>eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals. Try to drink several glasses of water or another non-alcoholic liquid every day. If you can, it may also help to do some exercise. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgpAQ-cirU">Watch a short video</a> on how to treat constipation.</li>
<li><strong>dizziness - </strong>this is probably due to <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Blood-pressure-(low)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">low blood pressure</a>. Drink plenty of water or a non-alcoholic drink. Do not stand up too quickly after sitting or lying down.</li>
<li><strong>dry mouth</strong> - chew sugar-free gum or sugar-free sweets</li>
<li><strong>feeling sleepy</strong> <strong>or tired </strong>- take amitriptyline in the evening and cut down the amount of alcohol you drink.</li>
<li><strong>difficulty peeing - </strong>relax when you try to pee - don't try to force the flow of urine. If it doesn't happen, try again later. Talk to your doctor urgently if you can't pee at all.</li>
<li><strong>headache</strong> - make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Don't drink too much alcohol. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.</li>

    <p>Amitriptyline is not generally recommended in pregnancy or while breastfeeding.</p>
<p>No antidepressants are considered completely safe to take in pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Your doctor will only prescribe amitriptyline for you while you're pregnant or breastfeeding if the benefits of taking the medicine outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline and similar antidepressants have been linked with a small risk of problems for the unborn baby if you take them in early or late pregnancy.</p>
<p>For more information about how amitriptyline can affect you and your baby during pregnancy, read this <a href="http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/Medicine--pregnancy/Amitriptyline/">leaflet</a>. </p>
<h3>Amitriptyline and breastfeeding</h3>
<p>Amitriptyline is not usually recommended if you're breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline gets into breast milk. It's been linked with side effects like sleepiness in breast fed infants.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you want to breastfeed. There may be other medicines that you can take instead of amitriptyline.</p>

<h3><strong>Mixing amitriptyline with herbal remedies and supplements</strong></h3>
<p>Do not take St John's wort, a herbal remedy for depression, while you're taking amitriptyline as this will increase your risk of side effects. </p>

    <p>You may see an improvement in your symptoms after a couple of weeks, although it usually takes between 4 and 6 weeks before you feel the full benefits.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking amitriptyline after a week or two just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least 6 weeks to work.</p>

    <p><span>Antidepressants like amitriptyline help to jump start your mood so you feel better. You may notice that you sleep better and get on with people more easily because you're less anxious. Hopefully you'll take little things that used to worry you in your stride.</span></p>
<p><span>Amitriptyline won't change your personality or make you feel euphorically happy. It will simply help you feel like yourself again.</span></p>

    <p>Once you're feeling better it's likely that you will continue to take amitriptyline for several more months. Most doctors recommend that you take antidepressants for 6 months to a year after you've stopped feeling depressed. Stopping before then can make depression come back</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of continuing to take amitriptyline for longer than a few months. It will depend on how bad your symptoms are, whether it's a one-off problem or one that keeps coming back, how well amitriptyline works for you and whether you've had any bad side effects.</p>

    <p>You may get withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking amitriptyline, especially if you stop taking it suddenly.</p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms are usually harmless but unpleasant. To help prevent them, your doctor might recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks.</p>

    <p>Amitriptyline can change how hungry you feel. Some people feel more hungry when they're taking it - others feel less hungry. So your weight may change when you first start taking it.</p>
<p>If you start to have problems with your weight while taking amitriptyline, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>

    <p>Amitriptyline doesn’t work any better or worse than other antidepressants. However, for some people, the side effects are a problem and they may have less side effects with another antidepressant. Sometimes people respond better to one antidepressant than to another.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor if you aren't feeling any better after taking amitriptyline for 6 weeks or if the side effects are still a problem</p>

    <p>Antidepressants, including amitriptyline, are just one of several approaches to treating depression. Other potential treatments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>talking therapy (such as <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cognitive-behavioural-therapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>)</li>
<li>exercise programmes</li>
<li>help to get a good night's sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on how long you've had depression, your symptoms, whether you've had any previous bouts of depression, whether previous treatment has worked, how likely you are to stick with your treatment, the potential side effects and your preferences and priorities.</p>

    <p>The good effects of amitriptyline may, after a while, improve your sex life as your mood lifts and you become interested in life and relationships again.</p>
<p>Some of the possible negative effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>men having problems with getting an erection and problems with ejaculating</li>
<li>women having some vaginal bleeding</li>
<li>both men and women having breast swelling</li>
</ul>
<p>Sexual side effects are not common and should pass after the first couple of weeks. If they don't, and this is a problem for you, go back to your doctor to see if there's another antidepressant you can try.</p>
<p>If you're a woman and you get <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/postmenopausal-bleeding-or-spotting/Pages/Introduction.aspx">vaginal bleeding after the menopause</a>, make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Cannabis with amitriptyline can make you feel especially sleepy, especially if you've just started taking amitriptyline. Cannabis with amitriptyline can also give you a fast heartbeat. </p>
<p>It can be potentially dangerous to take amitriptyline with:</p>
<ul>
<li>methadone</li>
<li>stimulants like MDMA (ecstasy) or cocaine</li>
<li>hallucinogens like LSD</li>
<li>novel psychoactive substances (which used to be known as legal highs) like mephedrone  </li>
</ul>
<p>Amitriptyline hasn't been properly tested with recreational drugs. Talk to your doctor if you think you might use recreational drugs while taking amitriptyline.</p>
