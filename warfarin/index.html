                <p>Warfarin is a type of medicine known as an anticoagulant. It makes your blood clot more slowly by thinning your blood.</p>
                <p>It’s used to treat people who have had a health problem caused by a blood clot such as:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">deep vein thrombosis</a> (DVT) – a blood clot in the leg</li>

                </ul>
                <p>It’s also used to prevent blood clots if you’re at high risk of having them in the future. People who are at high risk include those with:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a replacement or mechanical heart valve</li>
                <li>an abnormal heartbeat, known as <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Atrial-fibrillation/Pages/Introduction.aspx">atrial fibrillation</a></li>
                <li>a blood clotting disorder, such as <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thrombophilia/Pages/Thrombophilia.aspx">thrombophilia</a></li>
                <li>a higher chance of having a blood clot after an operation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Warfarin is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets and as a liquid that you swallow.</p>

      <h2 class="o-section__header" id="how-when">How and when to take it</h2>
      <p>Warfarin is a prescription medicine. It’s very important to take it as your doctor advises.</p>
  <h3>How to take it</h3>
  <p>Take warfarin once a day, at about the same time.</p>
  <p>It's usual to take warfarin in the evening. This is so that if you need to change the dose after a routine blood test, you can do this the same day rather than waiting until the following morning.</p>
  <p>Warfarin doesn’t usually upset your tummy so you can take it before, during or after a meal.</p>
  <h3>How much will I take?</h3>
  <p>Warfarin tablets come in 4 different strengths. They're colour-coded to make it easier for you to take the right dose. The strengths and colours are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>0.5mg - white tablet</li>
  <li>1mg - brown tablet</li>
  <li>3mg - blue tablet</li>
  <li>5mg - pink tablet</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Warfarin also comes as a liquid, where 1ml is equal to a 1mg (brown) tablet.</p>
  <p>Warfarin liquid comes with a plastic syringe to help you measure the right amount. The numbers up the side show how much liquid you have in the syringe.</p>
  <p>The usual warfarin dose is 10mg (or 10ml of liquid) a day for the first 2 days. Then 3mg to 9mg (3ml to 9ml) a day after that.</p>
  <h3>How is my dose worked out?</h3>
  <p>Your dose may be made up of a different combination of coloured tablets. For example, for a dose of 7mg, you could be asked to take:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>2 x blue tablets and 1 x brown tablet or</li>
  <li>1 x pink tablet and 2 x brown tablets</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your warfarin dose may change often, especially in the first few weeks of treatment, until your doctor finds the dose that’s right for you.</p>
  <h3>Why do I need blood tests?</h3>
  <p>The aim of treatment with warfarin is to thin your blood but not stop it clotting completely. Getting this balance right means your dose of warfarin must be carefully monitored.</p>
  <p>You will be monitored with a regular blood test called the international normalised ratio (INR). This blood test measures how long it takes your blood to clot. The longer it takes, the higher your INR.</p>
  <p>The dose of warfarin that you need will depend on your INR. Your doctor will try to keep your INR within a certain target range. The target INR depends on your health problem, but most are 2 to 3 or 2.5 to 3.5 INR units. If the blood test shows your INR is out of the target range, your warfarin dose will be increased or decreased.</p>
  <p>You’ll have INR blood tests at your GP surgery or local hospital’s anticoagulant clinic at least once every 12 weeks to make sure your dose is right for you.</p>
  <p>If your INR is stable, you might only need a blood test once every 8 weeks. If it’s unstable, or you’ve just started on warfarin, you may need to have a blood test every week.</p>
  <h3>The yellow book</h3>
  <p>When you start taking warfarin you may be given a <a href="media/0417_anticoag-a5_book_15_eng.pdf">yellow book about anticoagulants</a>. This explains your treatment. Remember to take your yellow book with you to all of your warfarin appointments.</p>
  <p>Your warfarin dose will be written down in it each time you visit your doctor or anticoagulant clinic.</p>
  <p>You’ll also be given an anticoagulant alert card. Carry this with you all the time. It tells healthcare professionals that you’re taking an anticoagulant. This can be useful for them to know in case of a medical emergency.</p>
  <p>If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your anticoagulant alert card to the nurse, doctor or dentist. This includes before you have vaccinations and routine sessions with the dental hygienist. You may need to stop taking warfarin for a short time, or you may need to change your dose.</p>
  <h3>What if I forget to take it?</h3>
  <p>If you miss a dose, make a note in your yellow book.</p>
  <p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If you don’t remember until the next day, skip the missed dose and take your normal dose at the usual time.</p>
  <p>Never take more than 1 dose a day.</p>
  <p>If you’re worried, contact your anticoagulant clinic or GP.</p>
  <h3>What if I take too much?</h3>
  <p>If you take an extra dose of warfarin by accident, call your anticoagulant clinic straight away. You may need to change your next dose of warfarin, or have a blood test.</p>
  <p>If you take more than 1 extra dose of warfarin by accident you’re at risk of serious bleeding.</p>
  <p><strong><span class="c-callout__emergency">If you take more than 1 extra dose of warfarin by accident, call your doctor, anticoagulant clinic, or go to your <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/service-search/Accident-and-emergency-services/LocationSearch/428">nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department</a> straight away.</span></strong></p>
  <p>If you need to go to hospital, take the warfarin packet or leaflet inside it plus any remaining medicine with you. If you have a yellow book, take that too.</p>

      <h2 class="o-section__header" id="side-effects">Side effects</h2>
      <p>While warfarin has enormous benefits, the downside is that it can increase the risk of bleeding. This is because while you're taking warfarin your blood won't clot as easily.</p>
  <p>You’re more likely to get bleeding in the first few weeks of starting treatment and when you're unwell - for instance if you have flu, vomiting or diarrhoea.</p>
  <p>Apart from the risk of bleeding, warfarin is a very safe medicine.</p>
  <h3>Common side effects</h3>
  <p>Keep taking the medicine, but tell your doctor if the side effects bother you or don't go away:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>bleeding more easily than normal - for example, having heavier periods, bleeding for longer if you cut yourself, bleeding from your gums after you brush your teeth, and bruising more easily</li>
  <li>skin rashes</li>
  <li>hair loss</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Serious side effects</h3>
  <p>Occasionally, people get severe bleeding from taking warfarin. There’s often no warning of a serious bleed, but keeping your INR in the target range makes it less likely to happen.</p>
  <p><strong>Stop taking warfarin and tell your doctor straight away if you get</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>blood in your pee or poo</li>
  <li>black poo</li>
  <li>severe bruising or bruises for no reason</li>
  <li>nosebleeds that last longer than 10 minutes</li>
  <li>blood in your vomit or coughing up blood</li>
  <li>severe headaches</li>
  <li>heavier periods, or any other bleeding from your vagina</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Serious allergic reaction</h4>
  <p>In rare cases, it’s possible to have a serious allergic reaction to warfarin.</p>
  <p><strong><span class="c-callout__emergency">A serious allergic reaction is an emergency. Contact a doctor straight away if you think you or someone around you is having a serious allergic reaction.</span></strong></p>
  <p>The warning signs of an allergic reaction are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>developing a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin</li>
  <li>wheezing</li>
  <li>tightness in the chest or throat</li>
  <li>having trouble breathing or talking</li>
  <li>swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are not all the side effects of warfarin. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.</p>
  <p><strong><span class="c-callout__info">You can <a href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">report any suspected side effect</a> to the UK safety scheme</span></strong></p>

      <h2 class="o-section__header" id="how-to-cope">How to cope with side effects</h2>
      <p><strong>What to do about:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>cuts - </strong>press on the cut for 10 minutes with a clean cloth</li>
  <li><strong>nosebleeds </strong>-<strong> </strong>nosebleeds can be frightening but they aren't usually serious. Read about <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Nosebleed/Pages/Introduction.aspx">how to stop a nosebleed</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrDAeYCF79U&amp;feature=youtu.be">watch this video</a>. Call your doctor, anticoagulant clinic or go to your nearest hospital's A&amp;E department if a nosebleed lasts for longer than 10 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>bleeding gums</strong> - use a soft toothbrush and waxed dental floss to clean your teeth. If you wear dentures (false teeth) or retainers, take them out for a few hours a day to give your gums a rest. Don't wear dentures (false teeth) or retainers that don't fit properly.</li>
  <li><strong>bruising</strong> - bruises may happen more easily than normal and take longer to fade. It might help to speed up healing if you put an ice pack wrapped in a damp towel or cloth over the bruise for 10 minutes at a time several times a day.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What to do to prevent bleeding: </strong></p>
  <p>While you're taking warfarin be careful when you do activities that might cause an injury or a cut or bruising. It can help to:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>stop playing contact sports or other activities than can cause a head injury - such as football, rugby, hockey and horse riding</li>
  <li>wear gloves when you use sharp objects like scissors, knives and gardening tools</li>
  <li>use an electric razor instead of wet shaving with a blade</li>
  </ul>

      <h2 class="o-section__header" id="cautions">Cautions with other medicines</h2>
      <p>Many medicines and supplements can interfere with warfarin. This can lead to serious side effects. You might need a blood test to check the other medicine isn’t affecting how your blood clots.</p>
  <p><strong>If you’re taking warfarin, tell your doctor before starting to take these medicines</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>medicines for heart problems such as amiodarone, quinidine and propafenone</li>
  <li>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for example <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/">ibuprofen</a> and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/aspirin-for-pain-relief/">aspirin</a></li>
  <li>cholesterol-lowering medicines such as bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, clofibrate and cholestyramine</li>
  <li>antibiotics, such as <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/erythromycin/">erythromycin</a>, co-trimoxazole or norfloxacin</li>
  <li>vitamin K supplements</li>
  <li>miconazole gel for fungal infections like <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/thrush-in-men-and-women/">thrush</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Can I take warfarin with everyday painkillers?</h3>
  <p>It's safe to take <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/">paracetamol</a> while you’re on warfarin. But don't take more than 2g (4 tablets) a day for more than a few days. Taking more paracetamol than this may make your blood slower at clotting. This puts you at risk of bleeding.</p>
  <p>Do not take <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/aspirin-for-pain-relief/">aspirin</a> and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/">ibuprofen</a> while you’re taking warfarin unless a doctor has said it’s OK to. They increase the chance of bleeding.</p>
  <h3>Mixing warfarin with herbal remedies and supplements</h3>
  <p>Do not take St John's wort, the herbal remedy for depression, while you’re taking warfarin. It can increase your risk of side effects.​</p>
  <p><strong><span class="c-callout__alert">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal remedies, vitamins or supplements. </span></strong></p>

<p>Warfarin is a type of medicine known as an anticoagulant. It makes your blood clot more slowly.</p>
<p>Blood clotting (thickening) is a complicated process involving substances called clotting factors.</p>
<p>Clotting factors are made by the liver and help stop bleeding. They work with blood cells called platelets that trigger the clotting process to make sure your blood clots properly.</p>
<p>To make some of the clotting factors, the liver needs a good supply of vitamin K.</p>
<p>Warfarin blocks the liver from using vitamin K to make clotting factors. This thins your blood so it takes longer to clot.</p>

<p>Warfarin takes about 3 days to build up its blood thinning effect.</p>
<p>But it can take weeks or even months before you settle on the right dose. This is because everyone reacts differently to warfarin so it's usual for the dose to go up and down when you first start taking it.</p>
<p>You won’t feel any different while you take warfarin. The only way to check it’s working is to take a blood sample and see how long your blood takes to clot.</p>

<p>If you’ve had a blood clot in your leg or lungs, you will probably take a short course of warfarin for 6 weeks to 6 months.</p>
<p>If you take warfarin to reduce your risk of having a blood clot in future or because you keep getting blood clots, it’s likely your treatment will be for longer than 6 months, maybe even for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Do not stop taking warfarin without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>If you stop taking warfarin, the rate at which your blood clots will quickly return to what it was before you started taking it. This means that you may be at increased risk of serious problems like <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Stroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx">strokes</a>, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Heart-attack/Pages/Introduction.aspx">heart attacks</a>, <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/?WT.mc_id=organic_split">DVT</a> or <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-embolism/">pulmonary embolism.</a></p>

<p>Warfarin is one of the oldest and most commonly used anticoagulants.</p>
<p>There are newer anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban and edoxaban.</p>
<p>Warfarin doesn’t seem to be any better or worse than newer anticoagulants at treating and preventing blood clots.</p>
<p>However, the newer anticoagulants are more convenient because you don’t need to have regular blood tests.</p>
<p>Some people take <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/aspirin-low-dose/">low dose aspirin</a> to reduce their risk of heart problems. Aspirin makes your blood clot more slowly, but it works in a different way to warfarin.</p>
<p>Aspirin is as good as warfarin for some health problems, but not as good for others.</p>
<p>Not all medicines that prevent blood clots are suitable for everyone. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out why you've been prescribed a particular medicine.</p>

<p>You can drink alcohol while taking warfarin, so long as you stick to the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/alcohol-units.aspx">national guidelines</a> of 14 units a week for men and women. One unit of alcohol is roughly equal to a third of a pint of beer or a small glass (125ml) of wine.<br /><br />Drinking heavily - especially binge drinking lots of alcohol in one go - is dangerous while taking warfarin. The alcohol can increase warfarin’s effect and make you more likely to get bleeding.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to keep your diet stable. This means your dose of warfarin is more likely to stay the same.</p>
<p>Any big changes in what you eat or drink can change how your body responds to warfarin. Speak to your doctor or nurse before changing what you eat - for example before you go on a diet to lose weight.</p>
<p>Foods with a lot of vitamin K in can interfere with how warfarin works. They include green leafy vegetables, chickpeas, liver, egg yolks, cereals containing wheat bran and oats, mature cheese, blue cheese, avocado and olive oil.</p>
<p>It’s important that you eat foods containing vitamin K, so rather than leaving them out of your diet, make sure you eat the same amount of them regularly. This will mean the level of vitamin K in your blood stays fairly constant, and makes it more likely your INR level stays stable.</p>
<p>Do not drink cranberry juice while you’re taking warfarin. It may increase the effect of warfarin. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can still go to your dentist as usual. But tell your dentist if you're taking warfarin, before you have any treatment - especially if you need to have a tooth out. You may need to have blood tests before starting treatment to make sure your blood will clot enough to stop any bleeding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your dentist may suggest that you stop your warfarin for 2 to 3 days before you have your tooth out. However, some people don't need to change their warfarin dose and there should be no risk of complications afterwards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your dentist may contact your doctor for advice before starting the dental treatment.</p>

<p>It's safe for you to have vaccinations but tell the nurse or doctor that you're taking warfarin.</p>
<p>If the vaccine is normally given by injection into the muscle, then providing you're up to date with your INR tests, and the results are within the target range, you can have the injection as normal into muscle.</p>
<p>Or, the injection can be given into the layer of fat underneath your skin. This is called a subcutaneous injection. </p>
<p>It might help to prevent bruising if you press on the injection site for 10 minutes after the vaccination.</p>
