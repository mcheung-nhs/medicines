            <p>Co-codamol is a mixture of 2 different painkillers – paracetamol and codeine.</p>
<p>It’s used to treat short-lasting aches and pains including <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/symptoms/headache?WT.mc_id=organic_split">headaches</a>, muscular pain, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Migraine/Pages/Introduction.aspx">migraine</a> and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Toothache/Pages/Introduction.aspx">toothache</a>. It can also be used to reduce fever (38C and above).</p>
<p>It’s usually taken when everyday painkillers, such as aspirin, <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/">ibuprofen</a> and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/">paracetamol</a> alone, haven't worked.</p>
<p>Co-codamol comes in 3 different strengths. You can buy the lowest-strength co-codamol from pharmacies. The higher strengths are only available on prescription.</p>
<p>This medicine comes as tablets and capsules.</p>
<p>Co-codamol can be given to children from the age of 12. For over-16s, read our information on <a href="co-codamol-tabs-7-a.html">co-codamol for adults</a>.</p>

<li>The most common side effects your child might get are constipation, feeling sick and sleepiness.</li>
<li>Giving your child too much co-codamol can be harmful. Don’t be tempted to increase the dose or give a double dose if their pain is very bad.</li>
<li>It’s possible to become addicted to the codeine in co-codamol, but this is rare if your child is taking it to relieve pain under medical supervision.</li>
<li>Always leave at least 6 hours between doses and give a maximum dose of <strong>4</strong> co-codamol tablets in 24 hours.</li>

    <p>Co-codamol can be taken by children aged 12 and older. For children aged 16 and over, read our information on <a data-id="1222" href="/{localLink:1222}" title="Co-codamol tabs adults 1">co-codamol for adults.</a></p>
<p>Do not give co-codamol to children under the age of 12 as it can cause severe breathing problems.  </p>
<p><strong>Co-codamol is not suitable for some children. Tell your doctor before starting the medicine if your child</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>has lung problems or breathing difficulties</li>
<li>has a head injury</li>
<li>has adrenal gland problems</li>
<li>has an illness which causes fits</li>
<li>has liver problems</li>

      <h2 class="o-section__header" id="how-when">How and when to give</h2>
    <p>Co-codamol comes as tablets and capsules. They are swallowed whole with a drink of water.</p>
<p>Give your child co-codamol either before or after food.</p>
<p>If they find it difficult to swallow tablets or capsules, co-codamol is also available as soluble tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink. </p>
<h3><strong>How much to give</strong></h3>
<p>Co-codamol comes in 3 different strengths.</p>
<p>The amount of codeine it contains can be 8mg<span>, 15mg or 30mg</span>.</p>
<p>All 3 strengths contains 500mg of paracetamol - the same as in a standard paracetamol tablet or capsule.</p>
<p><span>The strength of co-codamol appears as 2 numbers on the packet. For example, the strength may be written as 8/500. This means it contains 8mg of codeine and 500mg of paracetamol.</span></p>
<p>You can buy the lowest strength of co-codamol (8/500) from a pharmacy without a prescription. The higher strengths (15/500 and 30/500) are only available on prescription from a doctor.</p>
<h3><strong>How often to give it</strong></h3>
<p>The normal dose for children aged 12 to 15 is 1 tablet of co-codamol up to 4 times a day.</p>
<p>Always leave at least 6 hours between doses.</p>
<p>The total maximum dose is <strong>4</strong> co-codamol tablets in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Overdosing on co-codamol can cause serious side effects. Don’t be tempted to increase the dose or give your child a double dose if their pain is very bad.</p>
<p>Do not give your child co-codamol that you have bought for more than 3 days. If the pain doesn’t improve after 3 days, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p><span class="c-callout__alert">The total maximum dose of co-codamol for children aged 12 to 15 is 4 tablets in 24 hours. Wait at least 6 hours between doses.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What if I forget to give it?  </strong></h3>
<p>If you forget a dose of co-codamol, don’t worry, just give it to your child when they next need pain relief. Then continue as before, giving doses every 6 hours if needed.</p>
<p>Never give your child 2 doses at the same time. Never give an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
<h3><strong>What if they take too much?</strong></h3>
<p>Giving them 1 or 2 extra tablets of co-codamol by accident is unlikely to be harmful. If this happens, wait at least 24 hours before giving your child any more co-codamol.</p>
<p>Giving more than 1 or 2 extra tablets can cause serious side effects. If your child has taken an accidental overdose they may feel very sleepy, sick or dizzy. They may also find it difficult to breathe. In serious cases they can become unconscious and may need emergency treatment in hospital.</p>
<p><span class="c-callout__emergency">If your child feels sleepy, sick, dizzy or finds it difficult to breathe, call 111 for advice straight away.</span></p>
<p>If your child needs to go to hospital, take the box or leaflet inside the packet plus any remaining medicine with you.</p>

<p>Your child is more likely to have side effects if they take the higher strengths of co-codamol.</p>
<h3><strong>Common side effects</strong></h3>
<p>Common side effects happen in more than 1 in every 100 children. Tell your doctor if they bother your child or don’t go away. Common side effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>constipation  </li>
<li>feeling sick or vomiting</li>
<li>feeling sleepy</li>
<li>headache  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Serious side effects</strong></h3>
<p>Serious side effects are rare and happen in less than 1 in 1,000 children.</p>

<li>a skin rash</li>

<li>getting a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin</li>

    <p>Co-codamol contains paracetamol and codeine. These 2 painkillers work in different ways to relieve pain.</p>
<p>Paracetamol seems to work by blocking chemical messengers in the brain that tell us we have pain. Paracetamol also reduces fever by affecting the chemical messengers in an area of the brain that regulates body temperature.</p>
<p>Codeine belongs to a group of medicines called opiates. It affects pain receptors in the central nervous system and the brain to block pain signals to the rest of the body. When codeine blocks the pain receptors, there are other unwanted effects - for example slow and shallow breathing. It can also slow down digestion, which is why codeine can cause constipation.</p>

    <p>Yes, taking co-codamol regularly for a long time could make your child addicted to the codeine in it. But in reality, if they are taking co-codamol to relieve pain (rather than using it as a recreational drug) it's very unlikely they will get addicted to it because they are not taking it to get a high.</p>
<p>If they need to take co-codamol for a long time their body can become tolerant to it. That means they need higher doses to control their pain. This isn't usually a problem when they stop taking co-codamol. Withdrawal symptoms can be prevented by reducing treatment gradually.</p>

    <p>It's not usually recommended to take co-codamol for longer than 3 days.</p>
<p>Taking co-codamol regularly for a long time can lead to addiction, which might make your child feel restless and irritable when they stop taking the tablets.</p>

    <p><span>Yes, there are other painkillers they can try.</span></p>
<p><span>Some painkillers work better than others for certain pains. For example, the best painkiller to ease a headache may not be the best one for backache.</span></p>
<p>Before giving your child co-codamol, try <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-children">paracetamol</a> to see if that helps the pain. Paracetamol can relieve most types of pain.</p>
<p>Painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-children">ibuprofen</a>, can reduce inflammation as well as pain. These are good for cold symptoms and aches and pains after an injury like a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Sprains/Pages/Introduction.aspx">sprain</a>. However, NSAIDs aren't suitable for some children. This includes children with stomach ulcers or severe heart, kidney or liver problems. If you would like to try NSAIDs please speak to your pharmacist or doctor.</p>
