<li>The most common side effects of co-codamol are constipation, feeling sick and sleepiness.</li>
<li>Taking too much co-codamol can be harmful. Don’t be tempted to increase the dose or take a double dose if your pain is very bad.</li>
<li>It’s possible to become addicted to the codeine in co-codamol, but this is rare if you're taking it to relieve pain under medical supervision.</li>

<p>Do not give co-codamol to children under the age of 12 as it can cause severe breathing problems.  </p>
<p><strong>Co-codamol is not suitable for some people. Tell your doctor before starting the medicine if you</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>have lung problems or breathing difficulties</li>
<li>have a head injury</li>

    <p>Co-codamol comes as tablets and capsules.</p>
<p>Swallow them whole with a drink of water.</p>
<p>For people who find it difficult to swallow tablets or capsules, co-codamol is also available as soluble tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink.</p>
<p>You can take co-codamol either before or after food.</p>
<h3><strong>How much to take</strong></h3>
<p>Co-codamol comes in 3 different strengths.</p>
<p>The amount of codeine it contains can be 8mg<span>, 15mg or 30mg</span>.</p>
<p>All 3 strengths contains 500mg of paracetamol - the same as in a standard paracetamol tablet or capsule.</p>
<p><span>The strength of co-codamol appears as 2 numbers on the packet. For example, the strength may be written as 8/500. This means it contains 8mg of codeine and 500mg of paracetamol. </span></p>
<p>You can buy the lowest strength of co-codamol (8/500) from a pharmacy without a prescription. The higher strengths (15/500 and 30/500) are only available on prescription from a doctor.</p>
<h3><strong>How often to take it</strong></h3>
<p>The normal dose for pain in:</p>
<ul>
<li>adults is 2 co-codamol tablets up to 4 times a day. Always leave at least 4 hours between doses. The total maximum dose is <strong>8 </strong>co-codamol tablets in 24 hours.</li>
<li>teenagers aged 16 to 18 is 1 or 2 tablets up to 4 times a day. Always leave at least 6 hours between doses. The total maximum dose is <strong>8 </strong>co-codamol tablets in 24 hours.</li>
<li>children aged 12 to 15 is 1 tablet of co-codamol up to 4 times a day. Always leave at least 6 hours between doses. The total maximum dose is <strong>4</strong> co-codamol tablets in 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overdosing on co-codamol can cause serious side effects. Don’t be tempted to increase the dose or take a double dose if your pain is very bad.</p>
<p>Do not take co-codamol that you have bought for more than 3 days. If the pain doesn’t improve after 3 days, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p><span class="c-callout__alert">The total maximum dose of co-codamol for an adult is 8 tablets in 24 hours. Wait at least 4 hours between doses.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What if I forget to take it?  </strong></h3>
<p>If you forget to take a dose of co-codamol, don’t worry, just take it when you next need pain relief. Then continue as before, taking your doses every 4 to 6 hours if needed.</p>
<p>Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p>
<h3><strong>What if I take too much?</strong></h3>
<p>Taking 1 or 2 extra tablets of co-codamol by accident is unlikely to be harmful. If this happens, wait at least 24 hours before you take any more co-codamol.</p>
<p>Taking more than 1 or 2 extra tablets can cause serious side effects. If you've taken an accidental overdose you may feel very sleepy, sick or dizzy. You may also find it difficult to breathe. In serious cases you can become unconscious and may need emergency treatment in hospital.</p>
<p><span class="c-callout__emergency">If you feel sleepy, sick, dizzy or find it difficult to breathe, call 111 for advice straight away.</span></p>
<p>If you need to go to hospital, take the box or leaflet inside the packet plus any remaining medicine with you.</p>

    <p>Co-codamol is not generally recommended during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Co-codamol contains paracetamol and codeine. While paracetamol is safe to take in pregnancy, codeine is not.</p>
<p>In early pregnancy, codeine has been linked to some problems in the unborn baby. If you take codeine at the end of pregnancy there's a risk that your newborn baby may get withdrawal symptoms after birth. It may also cause breathing problems in the baby after birth</p>
<p>It's not generally recommended for women to take co-codamol while breastfeeding. Small amounts of the codeine in co-codamol passes into breast milk and can cause breathing problems in the baby.</p>
<p>For some pregnant and breastfeeding women with moderate pain, there may be safer alternatives. Your doctor is the best person to help you decide what's right for you and your baby.</p>
<p>For more information about how codeine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy see the <a href="http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/Medicine--pregnancy/Codeine/">BUMPS leaflet</a>.</p>

    <p>Co-codamol contains paracetamol and codeine. These 2 painkillers work in different ways to relieve pain.</p>
<p>Paracetamol seems to work by blocking chemical messengers in the brain that tell us we have pain. Paracetamol also reduces fever by affecting the chemical messengers in an area of the brain that regulates body temperature.</p>
<p>Codeine belongs to a group of medicines called opiates. It affects pain receptors in the central nervous system and the brain to block pain signals to the rest of the body. When codeine blocks the pain receptors, there are other unwanted effects - for example slow and shallow breathing. It can also slow down digestion, which is why codeine can cause constipation.</p>

    <p>Yes, taking co-codamol regularly for a long time can make you addicted to the codeine in it. But in reality, if you're taking co-codamol to relieve pain (rather than using it as a recreational drug) it's very unlikely you will get addicted to it because you're not taking it to get a high.</p>
<p>If you need to take co-codamol for a long time your body can become tolerant to it. That means you need higher doses to control your pain. This isn't usually a problem when you stop taking co-codamol. Withdrawal symptoms can be prevented by reducing treatment gradually.</p>

    <p><span>Yes, there are other painkillers you can try.</span></p>
<p><span>Some painkillers work better than others for certain pains. For example, the best painkiller to ease your headache may not be the best one for your backache. </span></p>
<p>Before taking co-codamol, try taking <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/">paracetamol</a> to see if that helps your pain. Paracetamol can relieve most types of pain.</p>
<p>Painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/naproxen/">naproxen</a> and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/">ibuprofen</a>, can reduce inflammation as well as pain. These are good for joint, back and muscular pain. However, NSAIDs aren't suitable for some people. This includes people with stomach ulcers or severe heart, kidney or liver problems. If you want to try NSAIDs, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.</p>

    <p>Drinking alcohol while you're taking co-codamol can make you feel more sleepy. It can also increase the risk of serious side effects.</p>
<p>It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days of treatment until you see how the co-codamol affects you.</p>
<p>If you feel sleepy with co-codamol, stop drinking alcohol while you are taking it.</p>

    <p>Co-codamol can temporarily reduce fertility in men and women.</p>
<p>If you take high doses of co-codamol for a long time it can cause a health problem called hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is where the body doesn’t make enough sex hormones. This may make it more difficult for you to conceive.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about co-codamol and your fertility, talk to your doctor.</p>

    <p>If you take recreational drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, while you're taking co-codamol, you're more likely to get the serious side effects of the codeine in co-codamol. These include breathing difficulties, heart problems, fits and even going into a coma.</p>
<p>Some recreational drugs, such as cannabis, also increase common codeine side effects such as sleepiness and dizziness.</p>
<p>Taking heroin while you're on prescribed co-codamol is especially dangerous. You're more likely to get all the side effects of the codeine in co-codamol, including addiction.</p>
